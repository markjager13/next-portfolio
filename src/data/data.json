            "description": "A tool designed to improve office efficiency by generating a shift schedule and statistics form.",
            "introText": "Gallery Shift Calculator is an application I created while working at the Library of Congress as a visitor services specialist (non-tech role). At the time I was learning JavaScript and saw an opportunity to build something that would improve a routine office task. The app generates a shift schedule and statistics form based on the number of employees available.",
            "purposeText": "While working at the Library, one of our office's routine tasks was to draw up a schedule for staffing an especially crowded area of the building. We had to determine how long we wanted the area covered, how many employees were available, and how long each shift would be. My goal was to build an app that would generate a schedule at the click of a button and allow the user to select how it should be formatted (standard office schedule or statistics form).",
            "stackText": "Originally, I had built this app using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. More recently, I rebuilt the app using React in order to solidify my understanding of React concepts. Additionally, rebuilding this project also gave me the chance to better organize my CSS using CSS modules.",
            "problemsText": "My colleagues required text inputs instead of a date/time picker. This required me to translate the text inputs into date objects prior to performing any calculations. I also had to ensure that the start and end times of each shift were rounded, meaning each time should end in either a 5 or 0. To do this I added a few lines in the generate results logic that would alter the times appropriately before formatting the results.",
            "lessonsText": "This project helped deepen my understanding of react concepts. It also allowed me to explore alternative ways to solve common tasks. For instance I used react-hook-form to handle my form inputs. This tool performs input validation and you don't have to track value and onChange events manually. It really helped clean up my code. Also I learned how to use react portals to render my modal component. This provides the ability for an element to render outside the default hierarchy without compromising the parent-child relationship between components.",

            "introText": "This project was designed as a way to introduce myself and showcase my technical background.",
            "purposeText": "I got inspired to build a portfolio website while reading Josh Comeau's e-book, Building an Effective Dev Portfolio. It was my hope to create a website that would exemplify some of the advice expressed in the guide. Above all, I used this project as a way to learn more about Next.js and Styled-Components.",
            "stackText": "I had already built a similar portfolio website using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Admittedly, Next.js might be somewhat overkill for the purpose of designing a portfolio. However, I was excited to learn more about Next.js and some of the benefits it offers. Namely, things like server side rendering and dynamic routing can be especially useful for portfolios or blogs.",
            "problemsText": "Early on, I was having some difficulty in using dynamic routes and fetching the appropriate project data from a local file. I realized that I had not quite grasped getStaticProps and getStaticPaths, two functions that are critical for page pre-rendering and data fetching. The Next.js documentation was very useful in clearing up my confusion, along with Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Next.js Udemy course.",
            "lessonsText": "In addition to dynamic routing and static generation, I was also able learn a great deal about Styled-Components. For instance, styling elements dynamically using props and theming using the ThemeProvider component allowed for greater flexibility when implementing my dark mode toggle. Overall, I feel much more confident using Next.js and Styled-Components for future projects.",

            "description": "A full-stack web app that displays an ancient language quote based on user selection.",
            "introText": "This project was inspired by my interest in ancient history and dead languages. The app generates a random ancient language quote that can then be translated into English. The frontend app fetches quotes from a simple backend API that I wrote using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.",
            "purposeText": "I thought a quotes app was a great way to review my knowledge of working with plain JavaScript on the frontend. Also, instead of relying on a quotes API that had already been built, I decided to build my own in order to test my understanding of Node.js.  ",
            "stackText": "The frontend consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I decided to take a break from frameworks/libraries and focus on using plain JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. As for the backend, I used Node.js and Express to set up a server and connect to MongoDB Atlas. Express made the process of setting up a server pretty easy and allowed me to get the backend up and running relatively quickly.",
            "problemsText": "While building this project I had to consider how each quote would be retrieved and displayed. Since the database was relatively small (124 total quotes), one approach would be to have the client fetch all quotes from the backend API on page load. I could then use Math.random to randomly select a quote to display. Alternatively, I could retrieve a single quote from the backend and DB for each request. I chose the latter option since fetching single quote per request was lighter and faster. I also chose this approach since I wanted to practice building several different routes on the backend (one for each language category).",
            "lessonsText": "Building this project was good practice and allowed me to review how data flows between client and server. It was also nice getting to work with a database. I've done some Java/MySQL work during school and have worked through some Node.js/MongoDB tutorials. However, I wanted to test my understanding of backend Node.js, Express, and MongoDB by building something myself.",
